This will be the home repository for the code used on the robotics project.

Getting set up:
1) Clone github.com/illusional/roboticsproject

2) Set up Android Studio to work with Github (Press on VHS on menu bar)

3) Work on a BRANCH. This part is crucial.

4) To commit changes press ctrl + k, and use the commit option

5) Commit changes to your own branches of the code, then submit a pull request to the master branch.

Sacha, Baptiste and Philip can approve pull requests, this may be changed later on in the project.

Remember to:

1) Give a summary and description to all changes that you push.

2) Add comments for the code that you write

Coding Conventions:

1) Use camel case for variable and method names (writeItLikeThis)

2) Use the following convention for motor names [insert naming scheme later]

Post on the #programming channel if you need any help.
